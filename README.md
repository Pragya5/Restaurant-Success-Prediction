"# Restaurant-Success-Prediction" 
The Indian Restaurant Market is said to be one of the fastest growing in the world. As per the National
Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) report, the market is growing at a compounded rate of 9%.
This is because opening a restaurant in the near future would draw new opportunities for the budding
restaurant owners despite the challenges faced by the restaurant owners in recent years. Thus,
opening a restaurant requires knowledge of various critical areas to invest in, in order to make the
venture successful. This is often not straightforward as it depends on various factors like location,
cost, cuisine and other services they offer like home delivery etc. With the number of restaurants
opening each day, a new restaurant owner with the help of these factors can determine how to best
attract more customers thus scoping out their competition and improve their overall rating. The aim
of this project is to gain insights from a restaurant aggregator (Zomato) and predict the performance
of a restaurant based on three categories: Excellent, Very Good and Satisfactory.
